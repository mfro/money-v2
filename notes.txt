ideas:
  attach
  detach
  update

node:
  /new
  /attach?id=...

namespacing:
  attach is a json path
  would need some sort of access control
  otherwise joining the root would show everything

plans:
  use node approach
  rust probably
  sqlite / mongodb
  consider for the future node ref type to allow referencing other nodes

  POST /new create node & return id
    201 { "id": "..." }

  WS /attach?id=...
    101 { ... }

features:
  hide the ID from the URL
  - maybe have a localStorage mapping from name -> id
    then have name in the URL
